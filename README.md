# README Regression Exercises

This README has all the regression exercises and work from codeup.

In this Module we learned about the entire Data Science pipeline and finished with learning about different types of Regression Models. 

Some highlights are: 

- [Wrangling Exercises](https://github.com/HeatherOrtegaMcMillan/regression-exercises/blob/master/wrangle_exercises.ipynb)
- [Data Scaling Notebook](https://github.com/HeatherOrtegaMcMillan/regression-exercises/blob/master/scaling.ipynb)
- [Exploration Notebook](https://github.com/HeatherOrtegaMcMillan/regression-exercises/blob/master/exploration.ipynb) 
- [Modeling Exercises](https://github.com/HeatherOrtegaMcMillan/regression-exercises/blob/master/regression_modeling_exercises.ipynb)

We finished off this chapter with a project using the Zillow data. [Here](https://github.com/HeatherOrtegaMcMillan/zillow_regression_project) is the repository for that work.
