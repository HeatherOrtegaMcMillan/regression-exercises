    "\n",
    "1. Create a new repository named regression-exercises in your GitHub; all of your Regression work will be housed here.\n",
    "2. Clone this repository within your local codeup-data-science directory.\n",
    "3. Create a .gitignore and make sure your list of 'files to ignore' includes your env.py file.\n",
    "4. Ceate a README.md file that outlines the contents and purpose of your repository.\n",
    "5. Add, commit, and push these two files.\n",
    "6. Now you can add your env.py file to this repository to access the Codeup database server.\n",
    "7. For these exercises, you will create wrangle.ipynb and wrangle.py files to hold necessary functions.\n",
    "8. As always, add, commit, and push your work often."

    "\n",
    "As a customer analyst for Telco, you want to know who has spent the most money with the company over their lifetime. You have monthly charges and tenure, so you think you will be able to use those two attributes as features to estimate total charges. You need to do this within an average of $5.00 per customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, you will complete the first step toward the above goal: acquire and prepare the necessary Telco data from the telco_churn database in the Codeup database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquire customer_id, monthly_charges, tenure, and total_charges from the telco_churn database for all customers with a 2-year contract.\n",
    "Using your acquired Telco data, walk through the summarization and cleaning steps in your wrangle.ipynb file like we did above. You may handle the missing values however you feel is appropriate and meaningful; remember to document your process and decisions using markdown and code commenting where helpful.\n",
    "End with a wrangle.py file that contains the necessary functions to automate your process from acquiring the data to returning a cleaned dataframe with no missing values. Name your final function wrangle_telco."
